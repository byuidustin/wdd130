    <h2>Dustin Webster</h2>
    <h2>Redxray Or just Redx Or Dusty</h2>
    <p>I am 28 years old I am taking a business managment degree. I currently have a wife and four daughters and we are wanting more kids around 8 kids in total. I like to read and play video games and sing with my family i go on lots of walks around my neighborhood.</p>
    <p> I currenly do not work as i am in the process of opening a 3D printing shop in order to suppport my family. I like BYUI currently because they do not require me to come to campas I love the flexability this school has for its degree programs.</p>
    <p> I do see an advantage to takeing web design because it allows for me to better help my business grwo by making my own website. I have been a memeber of the church my whole life and do not plan on stoping anytime soon. My favorite scripture story is of the prophet Ammon.</p>
